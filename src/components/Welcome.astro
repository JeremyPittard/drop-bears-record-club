  <h1>Australian music deserves better.</h1>
  <p>
    The talent's there, just like it always has. But what's missing is support
    and a way forward. The industry is now built on safe bets, not new voices.
  </p>
  <p>
    We're not here to play nice or wait our turn. We're building something
    louder. A grassroots way to surface what's real, share it, and give artists
    a shot without having to kiss the feet of the overlords.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is for the fans who still give a shit. For the artists doing it without
    a marketing team. For the community that shows up, buys the merch, and tells
    their mates.
  </p>

  <p>Welcome to Drop Bears Record Club.</p>
